// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function storecarinfo(Manufacturer:string, modelName: string, ...extraOption: {[key :string]: any} [] ):object{

    const carinfo = {
        Manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extraOption)
    }

    return carinfo;
};




let answer = storecarinfo('Honda', 'Civic', {color:'Black'}, {features: ['Navigation', 'Power window']})

console.log(answer);
